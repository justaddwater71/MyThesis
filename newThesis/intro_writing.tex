\section{Things to Remember When Writing Your Report or Thesis}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Punctuation (periods and commas) go inside quotation marks. 
\item Use the \LaTeX \verb+\begin{figure}+ and \verb+\begin{table}+ environment to
  create floating figures and tables. Use the \verb+\caption+ command
  to create your captions. Label your captions with the
  \verb+\label{foo}+ command inside the caption itself. Reference
  these figures and tables with the \verb+\ref{foo}+ reference command.
\item When using \emph{i.e.,} \emph{e.g.,} or \emph{etc.}, always put
  a comma before and after, \emph{e.g.}, like this.
\item Do not split text around a figure or table. 
\item Master's degree has an apostrophe and Postgraduate is one word. 
\item If you use ``however,'' make sure there's a comma before and after,
unless you 
start a sentence with it. However, it's best not to start a sentence
with ``however.'' And while we're on the subject, you should try to avoid starting a sentence with ``and'' or ``because.'' 
\item When typing a date, do not use ``st'' or ``th.'' Instead, just
  note the date: July 4, 1776, is Independence Day. Commas go 
after Month/date, year. No comma between month/yr. 
\item Spell out numbers 1 through 9. 
\item Use automatic numbering and lettering.
\item Capitalize C in Chapter, F in Figure and T in Table when referring
to chapters, 
figures or tables in the text. Better yet, use the \verb+\chapref+,
\verb+\figref+ and \verb+\tabref+ commands in the NPS report template.
\item When there is more than one reference, put them both into the \verb+\cite+ command: \verb+\cite{john1,john2}+.
\item Avoid writing in the first person!
\item Make sure there's at least one and a half lines of text at the
  top of the page---if \LaTeX gives you a hard time, you may need to
  add or remove text so that everything works out properly.
\item (omitted)
\item Footnote numbers go outside the punctuation. 
\item When typing equations in text and use ``where'' or ``if.'' Use
  Math Mode. 
\item When inserting symbols, use Math Mode.
